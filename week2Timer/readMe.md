This assignment was surprisingly difficult for me. At first I had trouble getting the time to go to quarters of a second rather than a second.
I watched some tutorials on how to make a timer in JS and it still took a while to grasp how the code is actually telling the seconds, making it hard for me to know how to change the interval.
I eventually figured it out that it was in the "setInterval" that changed the actual length of the "seconds" so that was my first obstacle.
After that I had a pretty easy time setting up a <style> element in the head of my html document. <br> 
I was feeling pretty confident that I had it, but then I ran into what became my biggest obstacle. I could get the box centered, but the text of the numbers ticking down, and the "timer done" text was never centered in the same place!
I looked through CSS properties on W3 schools and fidgedted with a bunch of them until I got it to somehow center (mostly)!
I honestly am still pretty confused as to why the different text items were in different spots when they were coded with the same class and id and should have been affected the same by the CSS.
But for a while the timer was centered perfectly but when it got to "timer done" that would be on the top of the background area! After nearly giving up I decided to try to change the "align-items" CSS property from "stretch" to "center" somehow that did not affect the timer at all but centered the "timer done" text.

I am pretty confused as to how this all happened and why the text objects were appearing differently when I thought they should have the same properties. 
However, as confused as I still am I can't say that it wasn't satisfying to magically make it work.
