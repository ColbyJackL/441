For this assignment I attempted to make a Create Your Own Adventure interactive game. It was actually very difficult for me and I wasn't able to figure out how to get the user to change the character name.

I was able to get it to look pretty nice for how simple it is but I was also having trouble get it to "dynamically change based on the choices made by the reader" as the assignement suggested it should. 

One other thing that I would like to add is rather than having the steps stack on top of each other, I want to get the previos one to disappear, or at least make the buttons inactive so you can't just click through every possible option in 15 seconds.

I am hoping we have more time to refine this assignment and go over some of these concepts this next week, but I am happy with what I was able to accomplish.
